# menu-system
 A full-stack project where we can manage menus using clean architecture, java with spring boot and react. In this project, I used Java on the back end and React with TypeScript on the front, to build a responsive and beautiful page for our Mind.

___It is worth mentioning that I decided to put the front-end and the back-end in the same repository because this is a small project.___

 
## Configuration
